    Any gaps (distances between hits) in peaks larger than min_gap_size_for_break are tested by computing a

    If it is larger than min_split_goodness(n_hits), the cluster is split at that gap and the declustering is
    called recursively for the newly minted clusters.

    The threshold function min_split_goodness(n_hits) has to be chosen so that S1s and S2s are not split up.
    This can be done by simulating them with pax's integrated waveform simulator.

    that affects the signal shape (in particular, a change in electric fields).
