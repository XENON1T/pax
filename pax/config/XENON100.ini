# This file contains a dictionary defining the neural net for XENON100
# The dictionary has three keys:
# 'structure' is a list of the number of nodes per layer (including input and output layer)
# 'weights' is a list that stores the weights of the connections between all nodes
# 'biases' is a list that stores the biases for all nodes (except input nodes)
# Specific information about weights and biases is given below
neural_net_file = 'NN_XENON100.npz'

# Biases used by the neuron activation functions, taken from nn-missing_9_12_39_58.c
# Input neuron's don't use a bias, so there should be hidden_layer_neurons + 2 biases
# In nn-missing_9_12_39_58.c input neurons had biases, but they were unusued (random [-1,1]?)

# Weights of the connections, taken from nn-missing_9_12_39_58.c
# The first n_top_pmts * hidden_layer_neurons are for the connections from the input to the hidden layer:
#   The first 98 for the first hidden layer neuron, the next 98 of the second hidden layer neuron, etc
# The next hidden_layer_neurons * 2 are for the connections from the hidden to the output layer
#   The first hidden_layer_neurons for the x-output neuron, the next hidden_layer_neurons for the y-output neuron, etc

# Neural network outputs position in this unit. Will be converted to pax units.
